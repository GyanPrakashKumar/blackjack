# blackjack

The player or players are dealt an initial two-card hand and add the total of their cards. Face cards are counted as ten points. The player and dealer can count his own ace as one point or 11 points. All other cards are counted as the numeric value shown on the card. After receiving their initial two cards, players have the option of getting a "hit," which means taking an additional card. In a given round, the player or the dealer wins by having a score of 21 or by having the highest score that is less than 21. Scoring higher than 21 results in a loss. A player may win by having any final score equal to, or less than 21 if the dealer busts. If a player holds an ace valued as 11, the hand is called "soft", meaning that the player cannot go bust by taking an additional card; otherwise, the hand is "hard".
